   With my application, you will be able to check the weather and whether there is a thunderstorm, snowing, sunny, etc, from major cities across the world by just typing in your city name. My app isn't compared to other weather applications as my app only gives you the degrees in fahrenheit. I hope you are able to use my easy to use weather app.
